### Python and Jupyter Notebook

Install anaconda

Then, you can access your python and anaconda, solely through `anaconda prompt`

In Anaconda, an environment is both a python environment, and a set of packages for a project



Open jupyter notebook by running

`jupyter notebook` in the anaconda prompt



To stop the notebook, do `jupyter notebook stop`  (from another command prompt)

Honestly, this will probably be a better summary: https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf 



Indeed there is a lot of info, but most important is to just know the following:

1. You can make new environments, with different versions of python and different sets of packages
2. To switch to them, you just run `activate <env_name>`
3. To deactivate run `deactivate` 

That's it. The paradigm, of "going to a new environ", as pioneered by the more complex virtualenv, which tied it to a folder environ, is the same.
